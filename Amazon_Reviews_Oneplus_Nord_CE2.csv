3,4.0,Good enough,Battery life is good and I liked high speed charging. So far haven't faced heating or hanging problem.  Gestures are very good. Camera features are good but portrait mode could have been better and also same goes with fingerprint.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 September 2022

6,4.0,This is good in terms of display. Camera is not as good as old phones.,"Previously, I used a Samsung Galaxy A8 Plus. This phone is nowhere near to it in terms of display and camera quality. I think the hardware of old phones were really good. This phone has a lesser pixel size on the camera sensor. Therefore it's hard to get quality shots at low light. These photos are shot in pro mode. Camere really disappointed me. The display is okay. Android 12 gives a nice UI. Vibration and haptics are horrible when compared to my old phone. The colors are also facing some issues. This is my opinion.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 12 August 2022
7,4.0,A decent package for non gamers and everything thing is decent not the best out there,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 26 February 2022

21,5.0,A Pragmatic User's Take,"This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned. If you're someone like me, who wants to jump from the 10k range to a mid-range costing smartphone, I would suggest you go for it. My father and I bought the same phone model on the same day almost three months ago, both of us are not gamers or heavy users, but we prefer the smoothness of everyday workflow over everything else. So if you hate it when your phone takes an extended period of time to open up simple applications, you will love to upgrade to this. I had my apprehensions before buying because of the sceptical comments related to OnePlus dropping its quality, but frankly: I did not see a difference since I have never used a phone beyond the 20-25k price range. Spending more than this amount on a smartphone is just plain splurging in my opinion, especially for middle-class people like us.It does not have any apparent issues, if you take good care of it, I think it should probably last long.All in all, if you're looking for a no non-sense smartphone and think of a phone pragmatically and don't wish to delve into minute details, I would suggest going for this without any second thoughts.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 September 2022

 I am reviewing what I am facing in day to day task , using the phone since 1.5 months :Pros:1. Performance is superb, didn't feel any lag or bug yet.2. OS & Software: Got 2 security updates & 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)5. Gaming Performance: don't play any games so look some other's review.6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.9. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brand neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.Cons:1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.2. Camera should be improved in low light.3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.Pro Tips: 1. Use ""Ultra Steady Mode"" to take video for your content/personal memory.2. Select 'Standard Refresh Rate' for better battery output.I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 September 2022

44,4.0,Decent phone,"Bought this phone at 22K inr. So consider this price for my review.Camera is hit and miss. Sometime it takes amazing shot, sometimes it just fumbles.EIS with 1080p60 is amazing. You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.",7 July 2022

 To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.1. DisplayThe display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.2. Processor & RamI have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.3. BatteryYour phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.4. CameraI don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.The front camera is quite good.5. Design & BodyThere is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.6. Operating SystemLoved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 16 September 2022

Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.Camera quality is average.

179,3.0,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",28 February 2022
180,5.0,A good choice for upgrade,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 February 2022

227,5.0,Mid ranger Flagship.,I got this mobile for ₹ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ₹3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ₹20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 February 2022

426,4.0,Practical phone,"Review after 10 days.It's a very good and practical phone if you are able to purchase it under 20k by applying coupons and exchange.Build : I like metal build but Ok with the plastic and Glass builds as well. This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 March 2022

And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered.

The screen is beautiful and there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and back.Now, coming to the battery, it easily lasts a whole day and it charges real quick and you're ready to use it whole day (100% battery)after just 35-40 mins of charge.I do casual gaming (BGMI and COD) and I didn't find any lag or jitter.

544,4.0,Affordable good quality.,"A big fan of 1+ phones n this is my fourth 1+ during last 6-7 years. Reason : Price competitive for the same specs of other Chinese competition makes. That brings the brand No. 2 in sales. But, definitely the brand's overall quality including battery is getting deteriorated since it has been started assembling in Vivo Noida plant.Now abt this product : Plastic type body doesn't give that bad impression, as often critics say. Other established brands in this range n specs r also have plastic body to make product lighter, though it adds to poor heat dissipation problem. U can't feel that unless u have ""never satisfied"" typo critic eyes.Call quality n internet performance is superb matching to processor specs. Can handle group video calls well in even weaker net. Picture quality is awesome with good color n in-depth reproduction. Heavier games make it hotter, but again that's the problem with every phone. Better remove phone cover while playing games.",3 April 2022

552,5.0,Absolutely Fantastic Phone,"Here are some important points that I noticed about the smartphone :1. Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.I am thankful to the seller for providing me the phone in best condition and I thank Amazon for free and fast delivery.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 16 June 2022

605,4.0,One Plus is Brand,I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery 🔋 stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera 📸 is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.,28 March 2022

641,4.0,A good phone to buy,"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 3 March 2022
642,5.0,Best in class,"I am writing this review after 15 days of usage.The phone is excellent in class. It's faster, smarter and better. The best thing about it is the superfast 65W charging feature.

715,5.0,Great value phone for the price!,"I made the switch from my Samsung M51 to the Nord CE 2. I did a lot of research before settling on this phone. I read quite a lot of reviews as well. Here's my experience so far:1. I am not a gamer and do not use phones for gaming.2. I am not a photographer and am quite happy with simple photos. I don't care about contrast or saturation.3. I use my phone mainly for banking, messaging, browsing and calls.Switching from the Samsung M51, the Nord CE 2 feels a lot smoother. I can't tell much of a difference in the display between the two. The outdoor brightness for the phone is decent. There is no bloatware installed on the phone which is fantastic (Samsung needs to learn from this!). Sure, there is no Android 12 out of the box but I don't miss it since I've never used it and Android 11 is perfectly fine. The phone will receive the Android 12 update but it might take time (I'm in no hurry). The camera is fine for my needs. It comes with a headphone jack and a charger. Charging is fast -- I went from 50% to 100% in under 25 minutes. I also like that the phone is slightly smaller than the M51 and fits well in my hand and pocket. I've not experienced any overheating issues.Overall, for the price (I got a great deal since I exchanged my phone), it's a great phone. Some people are expecting too much from this phone but if your needs are simple like mine, this is an excellent device.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 May 2022

A single charge should last 10-12 hours (minimum) if you are not a gamer or a constant user of the phone. And it comes with a 65w charger. It only takes 20 minutes to go from 0 to 80%.

837,3.0,Its very delicate!!,"I have no point of comparison except for my older oppo A83(2018) model. Thats an older model and yet very much better than the new ONE PLUS.  I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.😞 DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full.

1089,5.0,I don't see anything wrong with it. It's just a good phone. Delivery was shite though!,"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 6 April 2022

Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12.

1244,5.0,Best budget phone at this price!!!!,"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 14 March 2022

I am a true one plus fan. So my review on this phone is that it very basic.To be honest I am disappointed with the phone. I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is 👌🏻Cons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay.

I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",28 May 2022

1815,2.0,Not a value for money item,"Was having high expectations while buying. I own a Samsung S20 FE 5G and this OnePlus Nord CE2 was bought as a gift for mom. I should say that I was disappointed. There is a slight lag issue(many already reported, which I ignored while buying).Another thing I noticed is that, the call recording feature is hectic. Like the new phones, it starts the recording after the voice warning. But my S20 FE doesn't warn like this.Another thing is, the auto call recording can be enabled for all non-saved numbers, but for contacts saved in your phone, you would have to manually add them one by one to the list so that auto-recording would happen. That's the most stupid thing. Because most of us would have 1000s of contacts. And adding them one by one to the list for auto-call recording is a tedious task.Another issue is, the camera is way too below average. Expected a better camera from this phone.And I initially noticed some heating issue on the screen side.One advantage is that, the weight is less. So carrying it or using it with your hands won't be a headache.",20 June 2022

Honestly speaking nothing is there in the phone which makes exciting. Battery back is too bad if u are buying this, be ready to carry charge with u always. In Normal use battery back is only for 5-7 hrs ,no gaming just normal use and 30-50 minutes of YouTube video. Phone gets charged fast but it is not practical to charge phone twice or thrice in a single day 12-15 hrs. Heating from back side during charging.

2418,1.0,The phone has a software issue with regards to the camera.,"This is my first Oneplus purchase, and I got it for my mother. We have come from using Moto and Lenovo phones, which were decent and got the job done. If not for the damage in one of them, I would have continued with them.I had heard a lot of good this about Oneplus from my friends and family and was excited to get the phone.But on using the phone for a few days, I was left unsatisfied with the cameras. I personally use the Pixel 4a, and despite the pixel having a lesser resolution camera, it outshines the CE2. I was ok with that, because well, pixel is pixel. But, then the most bizarre thing happened. One fine day, the camera app stopped working completely (crashes at launch). Tried all the basic trouble shooting steps recommended by Oneplus, but nothing worked. The flashlight toggle in the notification shade was also greyed out with the message 'camera in use', even after resetting the device completely.At this point, I booked a service request with the care app and sent it for repair. Got the device back in a week, working properly. But to my surprise, after a week of use, the same problem has happened again.I am extremely disappointed and frustrated at this point. This was not expected from Oneplus as a brand. This has left an awfully bad first impression on me and I would not recommend this phone / brand to anyone, based on this experience.",1 August 2022

Due to omnivison camera, picture quality is not good in low light.. Okayish camera3. No inbuilt app for messages, dialer, recorder, notes.. All are google based apps4. MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue6. After software update, for twice my audio was not working, had to restart again7. Battery drains fast in ambient display mode..8. Did not find any difference in power saving mode aa compare to normal mode.. Battery drains in same speed in both mode..9. I mean its 2022, then why android 11?10..No stereo speakerFew pros :-Look wise its best.. Display is top notch..

2770,1.0,WORST PHONE EVER,"I consider this as the worst phone that i ever bought, just after one and half month of use the display of the phone went BLANK ( showing nothing just like switched off display) without doing any physical damage. for customer service i had to take the phone to BANGALORE as people in nearby service center said its not possible for them to service this problem and it is done in bangalore only. In bangalore these service center people initially tried blame me that i mast have done some physical damage even after explaining them that  i havent done anything. however they agreed to repair the phone they said display of the phone has to be replaced and it would take 7 days (on 24/6/2022).  4 days later they called and said they have replaced the phone with new display but still its not working and need to run the software check and need my permission to erase all my data ( that means it is not the display problem in the first place and they were blaming me, instead they should have done the software check first) . its been a week since i havent heard from them neither they are picking my call ( worst customer service) .i demand replacement with the new phone.beware before buying this phone.... its not what you think... if something goes wrong you will not get the reliable customer service/response.",5 July 2022

3238,2.0,"Not for any audiophile, USB audio is buggy","The USB audio in oneplus phone is merged with OTG, so each time you connect your external dac( fiio k9 pro, earman tramp, chord mojo) you need to switch on the OTG.But the bug start from there once any of this device disconnects you will need to restart you DAC again and again till it is by luck detected by the OnePlus phone again.In OnePlus forum the OnePlus team seems to be proud of this ""feature"" but as a developer I do not understand why they merged the USB audio with OTG.Over all this is not the phone for any one who use USB audio regularly. Irony is oneplus stoped adding audio jacks to their phone and promoted the wireless accesories.In the end it's all about marketing and business.Never going to buy any OnePlus brand devices anymore.",4 March 2022

I think phone mic issues.----> Back camera not good---> phone touch also I felt bit lack.Like:--------+Fast charging, within 30min 100% charge .Front cam bit okay.Battery backup is good.8 5g bands. Support, dual 4g standby.**** If OnePlus can promise if they can do something on back camera quality and Audio improvements with updates buy it with any offers. Otherwise go for real me gt master or 9pro or 9pro plus.  And moto mobiles also good.

After purchasing it was getting heat up and now it's totally brain dead due to software and hardware issues.I have given it to one of the service center of OnePlus and waiting to get it repaired. I'm not sure it will work at its best after the service. Again this service center is not near to my home town so it is total loss of time and money.Really this was new model lunched by OnePlus and It was gift to my brother. After this incident my trust on OnePlus is reduced.Thank you.Best Regards.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 19 July 2022

Phone screen freezed on 20th May and I dropped the phone at your authorised service centre in jammu.As per service centre people the phone sreen is not working. How can it be that within 20 days of purchase the phone screen turns to be faulty and the service centre that they does not have spare parts to repair it . What warranty the company is offering if spare aren’t available. This was my first purcahse and i I think this will also turn out to be last with this kind of product and service. No response from customer care. Now they have given me 27 June date for receiving parts then it will be repaired,12 June 2022

4354,1.0,Not upto the mark or the Brand!,"In comparison to many other phones in the same segment, this model does not come upto the mark. Starting on a full charge in the morning the battery drained very fast without any usage and by evening it was 50%. In Oppo, for instance, which was my earlier phone (unfortunately it was stolen), I could watch 2 to 3 films one after another and still the battery would last me the whole day for other heavy usage things. Apart from this the 1+ battery charges very slow. The screen size is smaller, there is half a centimetre gap at the bottom where the screen does not come down right to the edge of the phone. That screen gap irritates as does the time display where the first number is in red. Another irritant as the eyes misread it most of the time! Sound quality is shrill and not nice. Colour display is dull Camera and the pictures taken are ok.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 4 May 2022
